        <h1>Binary Search</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Binary search is a searching algorithm that is capable of finding a value
        inside a sorted list in <b>O(logN)</b>  time complexity. It is often quite
        necessary to search for a value inside huge lots of data, and binary search
        provides a time and memory cheap method of doing so. If a list of integers
        is simply <b>kept sorted as it grows</b>, searching an element will always have
        O(logN) time complexity.</p>

        <p>An alternative to binary searching a list is maintaining a Map data structure
        that provides O(1) lookup time, but only on the cost of memory. This is exactly
        why binary search is neat!</p>
        
        <h3>Below are the steps for Binary Search: </h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li> Input search element from user</li>
            <li> Locate the middle-most element inside the sorted list</li>
            <li> Compare the element to be found with the middle-most element</li>
            <li> If the element is the one that is being searched, return it!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, check if the element to be searched is bigger or smaller than the element it was compared to</li>
            <li> 
                <ul>
                    <li>If smaller, repeat steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 for the left sublist</li>
                    <li> If bigger, repeat steps 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 for the left sublist</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat the process until the element being searched is found or if the sublist is 1-item big
            </li>
            <li>
                If the 1-item sublist does not contain the item, indicate that the item is not present!
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Example Implementation</h2>

        <img src="array.png" alt="Sorted array">

        <p>Let us search for element 2!</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Middle Most Element of Array: 5</li>
            <li>Comparing 2 and 5 shows that 3 < 5</li>
            <li>Re-implementing Binary Search on left part of array (element 0 to 2)</li>
            <li>Middle most element is on index (0+2)/2 = 1, which is 2</li>
            <li>Comparing 2 and 2 shows that the element was found!</li>
            <li>Returning index of element to be found: 1</li>
        </ol>
